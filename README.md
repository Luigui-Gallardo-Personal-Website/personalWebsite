# Luigui's Personal website

Hello, this is my personal website. This is created with plain `HTML` and `CSS`. There is a function in `JavaScript` that prints the visitor's name.

For the style, I decided to use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Boostrap CSS framework</a>.

To test this website, download/clone all the files from this repository and open the `index.html` file. Here is an example with `git clone`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luigui-Gallardo-Personal-Website/personalWebsite.git
cd personalWebsite
open index.html
```
